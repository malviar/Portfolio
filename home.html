  <h2 style="text-align:center;">ABOUT LEA AND OUR MISSION</h2>
  <p> LEA stands for local, ethical and affordable. We're here to give students and community members in the
   Bay Area a resource to find stores and restaurants that fit around our motto.
   Why LEA?
   We, the founders, are students in the Bay Area and were inspired to create an outlet that we couldn't find. The idea
   first sprouted when we wanted to find local, ethical and affordable clothing/beauty stores all in one place, however, we stemmed
   to include more community aspects by exploring other things we enjoy—community events, volunteering and of course, discounts.</p>

<div class="bios">
Hey! My name is Ally. You'd normally find me wearing glasses, but I have to put my best face forward for a public bio. 
Over the summer, these amazing girls and I created this website as our Girls Who Code Final Project. We wanted to create an 
outlet for people to find affordable and ethical stores/products. Although I am an amateur at coding, I was really motivated 
by what we were able to create! Not only did I learn coing over the summer, I also learned that I'm great at wrapping laptop 
wires. <br>

hey my name is bella and im trying to figure out how long my bio can be before it carries over to the next column. right now 
im really happy that i got my parallax thing to work and it makes me feel really professional. soft edge or whatever hire me 
now. i like wrapping laptop wires and when theyre wrapped incorrectly i get triggered. i play league of legends. w3schools 
saves my life. i love boba and stuff so yeah lol. <br>

Hi y’all! I’m Daisy and that is my hand holding the pretzels on the home page. Honestly, I am an avid money spender but I am 
passionate about trying to make sure that my money goes to a good place. Because of that, I helped create this website 
alongside these gals. Aside from the small amount of coding I do, I love drinking boba, binge watching Netflix shows, 
and hanging out with my dogs. Instagram stalk me if you wanna see more of this flower

Hello there! I'm Maia and I've always wanted to learn how some of my favorite websites look the way they do. Spending a summer
with Girls Who Code has taught me this, and so much more! This site is the product of a week and a half of hard work and lots
of stress eating (shoutout to hot cheetos and cheese sticks). Besides coding, I love books but never seem to have enough time 
to read them. I also enjoy dragging my friends to various craft fairs across the Bay Area and exploring microbiology and 
graphic design. <br>
