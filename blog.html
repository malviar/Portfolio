  <p>Before, I thought robots were only machines like WALL-E and R2D2. Tody I learned that robots aresimply anything that is programmed to 
  perform a certain task. The rapidly advancing robotics industry is both exciting and a little scary. We should probably always be wary 
  of the possibility that we invent a robot/AI that has the potential to overtake humanity...but in the meantime, I think we should continue
  pushing the limits of what we can do with robots as much as we can.</p>
  
  <p>Working together in groups was a lot of fun, and I liked collaborating with other girls because we got tasks done more quickly than we would if 
  we were alone. Next time, we could try to be more organized and stay on the same page.</p>
