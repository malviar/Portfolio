  <p>Before, I thought robots were only machines like WALL-E and R2D2. Tody I learned that robots aresimply anything that is programmed to 
  perform a certain task. The rapidly advancing robotics industry is both exciting and a little scary. We should probably always be wary 
  of the possibility that we invent a robot/AI that has the potential to overtake humanity...but in the meantime, I think we should continue
  pushing the limits of what we can do with robots as much as we can.</p>
  
  <p>Working together in groups was a lot of fun, and I liked collaborating with other girls because we got tasks done more quickly than we would if 
  we were alone. Next time, we could try to be more organized and stay on the same page.</p>

  <p> Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard both work with robots who need to continuously adapt to their surroundings. With Veloso, her soccer bots
    and combots looked at their environment would dictate their further actions. Howards, in the TED talk we watched, explained how her bots
    "intellectually" evolved much like children do. Our team worked pretty well for the lightshow. We successfully delegated tasks and communicated
    effectively. If we had to do this project again, we could talk through each aspect (wiring and coding) more thoroughly to ensure everyone's on 
    the same page. Every Arduino sketch should have a setup() and loop() at the very least. Everything else differs depending on the purpose
    of the program.
